# x86-Basics

A few basic x86 programs built to be run on the legendary 8086, the Processor that started the x86 architecture. Run it on a 8086 emulator like [emu8086](https://emu8086-microprocessor-emulator.en.softonic.com/). Enjoy...

The Programs are named `Prog #-#`where `#` denotes the specific program index as shown by the list below.
